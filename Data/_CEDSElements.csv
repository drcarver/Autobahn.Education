The sources listed are complementary, rather than alternatives. That is, State UI records only include information for employees within a state's boundaries. The WRIS II system can provide employment data for other states (from their UI wage record systems). State UI records do not include information about federal or postal service employment, nor do they contain information about military enlistments. FEDES provides access to that information.

The candidate must associate the gap choices with the gaps in the image and be able to review the image with the gaps filled in context, as indicated by their choices. Care should be taken when designing these interactions to ensure that the gaps in the image are a suitable size to receive the required gap choices. It must be clear to the candidate which hotspot each choice has been associated with. When associated, choices must appear wholly inside the gaps if at all possible and, where overlaps are required, should not hide each other completely. If the candidate indicates the association by positioning the choice over the gap (e.g., drag and drop) the system should 'snap' it to the nearest position that satisfies these requirements.

001121|Assessment Item Body End Attempt Interaction XML||The end attempt interaction is a special type of interaction which allows item authors to provide the candidate with control over the way in which the candidate terminates an attempt. The candidate can use the interaction to terminate the attempt (triggering response processing) immediately, typically to request a hint. It must be bound to a response variable with base-type boolean and single cardinality. The XML from the IMS Global APIP Specification would be included.|Alphanumeric|0||https://ceds.ed.gov/CEDSElementDetails.aspx?TermId=20098|10|20098||
