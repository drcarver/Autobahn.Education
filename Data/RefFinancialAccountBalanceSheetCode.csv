If land is acquired by gift, the account reflects its fair value at the time of acquisition. Permanent improvements to land, such as grading and fill, should also be accounted for in this account. Land and land improvements are considered nonexhaustible assets owing to their significantly long expected useful life. Nonexhaustible assets are not to be depreciated. Therefore, assets classified by asset code 211 should result in no depreciation expense.||28.00||
29|Site Improvements|221|A capital asset account that reflects the value of nonpermanent improvements to building sites, other than buildings, that add value to land. Examples of such improvements are fences, retaining walls, sidewalks, pavements, gutters, tunnels, and bridges. If the improvements are purchased or constructed, this account contains the purchase or contract price. If improvements are obtained by gift, it reflects the fair value at the time of acquisition. Site improvements are improvements that have a limited useful life. Because these improvements decrease in their value/usefulness over time, it is appropriate to depreciate these assets.

Such bonds are usually issued at a deep discount from the face value, and no interest payment is made until maturity. Under full accrual accounting, the district is required to accrete the interest on the bonds over the life of the bonds. Accretion is the process of systematically increasing the carrying amount of the bond to its estimated value at the maturity date of the bond. To calculate accreted interest, the district should impute the effective interest rate, using the present value, the face value (or the future value), and the period of the bond, and multiply the effective interest rate by the book value of the debt at the end of the period. Accreted interest is usually recorded as an addition to the outstanding debt liability.||67.00||

78|Committed Fund Balance|730|The committed fund balance classification reflects specific purposes pursuant to constraints imposed by formal action at the district's highest level of decisionmaking authority (generally the governing board).
