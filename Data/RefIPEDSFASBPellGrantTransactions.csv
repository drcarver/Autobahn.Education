2|Federal grant revenue|Federalgrantrevenue|Pell grants are counted as federal revenue and allowance to tuition and fees and/or auxiliary enterprises (for room and board, books, meals, etc.). There should be an offsetting discount/allowance to tuition and fees revenue and/or auxiliary enterprise revenue so that the Pell grants are not being double counted in the institution's revenues.||||
3|Pass through|Passthrough|A pass-through transaction is essentially a payment on the student's account where the institution is purely processing the Pell Grant and those monies are not counted by the institution until they come in as a tuition payment from the student. The latter option is sometimes referred to as an agency transaction. With this option Pell grants are not counted as federal revenues and are not considered to be a discount/allowance to tuition and fees or auxiliary enterprises.||||
