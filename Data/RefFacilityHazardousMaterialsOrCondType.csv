People can also get lead in their bodies from lead in soil, paint chips and drinking water from lead-containing pipes or plumbing fixtures.||11.00||
12|Mercury|13665|Mercury is a naturally occurring element that is found in air, water and soil. Mercury is found in many rocks including coal. When coal is burned, mercury is released into the environment. High levels can harm the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, and immune system of people of all ages.||12.00||
13|Methane|13666|A hydrocarbon that is a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential most recently estimated at 23 times that of carbon dioxide. Methane is produced through anaerobic (without oxygen) decomposition of waste in landfills, animal digestion, decomposition of animal wastes, production and distribution of natural gas and petroleum, coal production, and incomplete fossil fuel combustion.||13.00||
14|Mold|02900|Molds are part of the natural environment. Outdoors, molds break down dead organic matter such as fallen leaves and dead trees, but indoors, mold growth should be avoided. Molds reproduce by means of tiny spores. Mold may begin growing indoors when mold spores land on surfaces that are wet.  Molds have the potential to cause health problems. Molds produce allergens, irritants, and in some cases, potentially toxic substances (mycotoxins).  Inhaling or touching mold or mold spores may cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.||14.00||
15|Nitrogen Oxides|13667|Gases consisting of one molecule of nitrogen and varying numbers of oxygen molecules. Nitrogen oxides are produced in the emissions of vehicle exhausts and from power stations. In the atmosphere, nitrogen oxides can contribute to formation of photochemical ozone (smog), can impair visibility and have health consequences, they are thus considered plants.||15.00||
16|Particulate Matter|13668|Very small pieces of solid or liquid matter such as particles of soot, dust, fumes, mists or aerosols. The physical characteristics of particles, and how they combine with other particles, are part of the feedback mechanisms of the atmosphere.||16.00||
17|Pesticides|02903|A pesticide is any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest. The health effects of pesticides depend on the type of pesticide. Some, such as the organophosphates and carbamates, affect the nervous system. Others may irritate the skin or eyes. Some pesticides may be carcinogens. Others may affect the hormone or endocrine system in the body.||17.00||
18|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)|13669|PCBs belong to a broad family of man-made organic chemicals known as chlorinated hydrocarbons. PCBs were domestically manufactured from 1929 until their manufacture was banned in 1979. They have a range of toxicity and vary in consistency from thin, light-colored liquids to yellow or black waxy solids. Due to their non-flammability, chemical stability, high boiling point, and electrical insulating properties, PCBs were used in hundreds of industrial and commercial applications including electrical, heat transfer, and hydraulic equipment.  Caulk containing PCBs was used in some buildings, including schools, in the 1950s through the 1970s. Although no longer commercially produced in the United States, PCBs may be present in products and materials produced before the ban. PCBs have been demonstrated to cause cancer, as well as a variety of other adverse health effects on the immune system, reproductive system, nervous system, and endocrine system.||18.00||
19|Propellants|13670|A propellant is a chemical used to create thrust. The material is usually expelled by gas pressure. The pressure may be from a compressed gas, or a gas produced by a chemical reaction. It may be a gas, liquid, plasma, or, before the chemical reaction, a solid.||19.00||
20|Radon|02902|Radon comes from the natural, radioactive breakdown of uranium in soil, rock and water and gets into the air. Radon gas decays into radioactive particles that can get trapped in the lungs through breathing. As they break down further, these particles release small bursts of energy. This can damage lung tissue and lead to lung cancer.  The most common method used to reduce radon is a vent pipe system and fan, which pulls radon from beneath the building and vents it to the outside.||20.00||
21|Refrigerants|13671|A refrigerant is a compound used in a heat cycle that reversibly undergoes a phase change from a gas to a liquid. Traditionally, fluorocarbons, especially chlorofluorocarbons were used as refrigerants, but they are being phased out because of their ozone depletion effects. Other refrigerants are ammonia, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and non-halogenated hydrocarbons such as methane. It is illegal to release refrigerants into the atmosphere (intentional or accidental) because they can cause severe damage to the ozone layer. When CFCs are removed they should be recycled to clean out any contaminants and return it to a usable condition. Refrigerants should never be mixed together. Some CFCs must be managed as hazardous waste even if recycled, and special precautions are required for their transport, depending on the legislation of the country's government.||21.00||
22|Sediment, sludge, reuse material|13672|Waste not regulated as "hazardous" may contain toxic metals such as mercury and lead, etc.||22.00||
23|Sulfur dioxide|13673|Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is one of a group of highly reactive gasses known as "oxides of sulfur." The largest sources of SO2 emissions are from fossil fuel combustion at power plants and other industrial facilities. Smaller sources of SO2 emissions include industrial processes such as extracting metal from ore, and the burning of high sulfur containing fuels by locomotives, large ships and non-road equipment. SO2 is linked with a number of adverse effects on the respiratory system.||23.00||
